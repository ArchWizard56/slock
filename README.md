# slock
This is a repo containing all the necessary PKGBUILDs and patches to build my version of slock.

## Installation

As far as I know, the PKGBUILD system is unique to Arch Linux so this installation is only supported for Arch.
Start by getting the repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/ArchWizard56/slock.git
```
Next, enter the directory.
```
cd slock
```
Then you can build and install the package with:
```
makepkg -si
```
